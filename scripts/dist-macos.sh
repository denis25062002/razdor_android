# Builds the macOS program into dist/: `razdor-macos`, one universal file for Apple Silicon
# (aarch64) and Intel (x86_64) Macs, from macOS 11 on. Like the others, put it into a
# Discord Times folder (next to DiscordTimes.exe, e.g. inside a Wine or CrossOver bottle) to
# play that install; elsewhere it uses RAZDOR_DT_DIR (also read from a .env file).
# Its SHA-256 is added to dist/SHA256SUMS (check a download with `shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS`).
#
# Runs on a Mac only (it links against Apple's SDK, from Xcode or its Command Line Tools);
# the targets come from rust-toolchain.toml. The program is not signed by a developer: the
# linker signs each half ad hoc, which Apple Silicon requires, and Gatekeeper blocks it once
# downloaded until the quarantine is lifted (see the README).
