# Changelog

What changed in each version of Razdor. The newest version comes first; changes not released
yet are under "Unreleased". Each release lists the SHA-256 of its programs, which anyone
can rebuild from the same commit with `scripts/dist.sh` (see the README).

## Unreleased

## 0.1.1 — 2026-09-30

### New
- **New game:** the scenario list groups the maps as the original does. A campaign is one
  row under its name («Раменское королевство», «Сказка странствий»), with its chapters
  listed under it in play order; single scenarios are rows of their own. The list scrolls
  with the mouse wheel when it is longer than the window.
- **New game:** each map shows its own picture in the map frame, as in the original; the
  terrain preview moves to a small square next to the name, status and size.
- **The tutorial offer:** the first «Новая игра» opens «Обучающий сценарий», the original's
  window with its picture and text. «Да» starts the tutorial map and the hero choice, «Нет»
  opens the scenario list. It comes once (remembered in `settings.json`), and not at all when
  the install says the tutorial is done.
- **No OpenGL driver:** when Windows offers only its OpenGL 1.1 fallback (a Remote Desktop
  session, or no graphics driver, as in many virtual machines), Razdor explains what to do,
  in Russian and English, instead of showing the bare "WGL_ARB_pixel_format is required".

### Changed
- **Battle:** the enemy under the mouse is framed green, as in the original, not red.
- **World map:** the hero cannot walk through any army, friendly or hostile; he goes
  around it, or stops if there is no way. Before, only armies standing guard blocked him.

### Fixed
- **Menu:** the «Рестарт» question closed at once, because the click that opened it also
  answered «Нет». A question now takes clicks only from the frame after it opens.
- **Load window:** the same flaw in the «Удаление сохранения» question could delete a save
  with one click, without showing the question.
- **Builds:** the programs' SHA-256 depended on the folder they were built in (the order of
  the path remappings in `scripts/dist.sh`). The same commit and tools now give the same
  files anywhere.

SHA-256 (built from commit 48af7af):

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-29

The first release: `Razdor.exe` (Windows x86_64) and `razdor` (Linux x86_64).

- Plays the original's scenarios from the player's own copy of *Discord Times*
  (Community Update 1.2): world map, buildings, armies, battles, economy, events and quests,
  spells, saves, sounds and music, with the original's art and texts read at runtime.
- The map editor, the built-in demo without an install, English and Russian interface.
- Army screen: items are dragged from the backpack onto a unit's card to give them to it,
  and between units.
- Settings: an optional FPS counter in the top right corner.
- Fixed a crash when the window is minimized or very small.
- The author's credit in the programs, the MIT license and the disclaimer.
