# Changelog

What changed in each version of Razdor. The newest version comes first; changes not released
yet are under "Unreleased". Each release lists the SHA-256 of its programs, which anyone
can rebuild from the same commit with `scripts/dist.sh` (see the README). From 0.1.2 the
release pipeline (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) builds and publishes a version when its
tag is pushed, and the SHA-256 are in the release's notes.

## Unreleased

## 0.1.2 — 2026-09-30

### New
- **Battle AI, easy or expert:** the settings window has the original's «Улучшенный
  интеллект противника в битве». Expert lets the enemy count a unit as killable when the
  actions it has left can finish it, not only with one hit. Until changed it follows the
  install's own setting (`OptValue9`).

- **Quests show places on the map:** when an event lights a lantern or shows an army, the
  camera flies there once its message is read and the uncovered area fades in from the fog,
  one place after another. A click on the map or Tab skips it.
- **Unit cards in battle** show every gain or loss against the start of the battle (blue
  raised, red lowered), also the lasting ones, and the building's defence in the D values;
  the unit panel writes it apart, as the original does («15 + 12»).

### Changed
- **Ships** on the map are the original's: the hero's galley (at sea and waiting at the
  shore), pirate ships and merchant cogs, rowing and turning as they move. The drawn
  placeholder is left only for playing without an install.
- **The noon report** no longer opens when nothing came in or went out that day (no
  income, no wages, nobody unpaid or gone).
- **Item restrictions** follow the original: shields need a melee attack (warriors only),
  artillery cannot use bows, the undead cannot wear holy items («Святое писание», icons…),
  and «Королевская корона» is for the hero and a few noble units.
- **Building defence** also counts in a friendly building for the hero's side, and for an
  enemy army attacked in a building of its own side (before: the hero's own buildings and
  castle garrisons only).
- **Battle:** a side with nobody in the front row steps forward at once, also at the start
  of the battle (as the player sees in the original), not only after a death.
- **Map:** buildings are drawn in front of hills, rocks and trees, which no longer hide them.
- **Market:** after a buy or a sale the selection moves to the next item (or the one
  above), for many trades in a row.
- **The autosave before a battle** is the moment just before it: loading it puts the hero
  on the map next to the enemy, not straight into the fight.

### Fixed
- **Item and spell bonuses on protections, regeneration and vampirism** (`p-` values) did
  nothing for a unit starting at 0%: «Святое писание», «Меч "Кровопийца"», «Латы
  крестоносца», «Шлем Героя» and others now give their percent.
- **Esc in battle** opened the ways out and closed them in the same moment, and did nothing
  while an animation played.
- **Music after loading a game:** the triumph of a battle won before no longer carries on;
  the map music starts again.

## 0.1.1 — 2026-09-30

### New
- **New game:** the scenario list groups the maps as the original does. A campaign is one
  row under its name («Раменское королевство», «Сказка странствий»), with its chapters
  listed under it in play order; single scenarios are rows of their own. The list scrolls
  with the mouse wheel when it is longer than the window.
- **New game:** each map shows its own picture in the map frame, as in the original; the
  terrain preview moves to a small square next to the name, status and size.
- **The tutorial offer:** the first «Новая игра» opens «Обучающий сценарий», the original's
  window with its picture and text. «Да» starts the tutorial map and the hero choice, «Нет»
  opens the scenario list. It comes once (remembered in `settings.json`), and not at all when
  the install says the tutorial is done.
- **No OpenGL driver:** when Windows offers only its OpenGL 1.1 fallback (a Remote Desktop
  session, or no graphics driver, as in many virtual machines), Razdor explains what to do,
  in Russian and English, instead of showing the bare "WGL_ARB_pixel_format is required".

### Changed
- **Battle:** the enemy under the mouse is framed green, as in the original, not red.
- **World map:** the hero cannot walk through any army, friendly or hostile; he goes
  around it, or stops if there is no way. Before, only armies standing guard blocked him.

### Fixed
- **Menu:** the «Рестарт» question closed at once, because the click that opened it also
  answered «Нет». A question now takes clicks only from the frame after it opens.
- **Load window:** the same flaw in the «Удаление сохранения» question could delete a save
  with one click, without showing the question.
- **Builds:** the programs' SHA-256 depended on the folder they were built in (the order of
  the path remappings in `scripts/dist.sh`). The same commit and tools now give the same
  files anywhere.

SHA-256 (built from commit 48af7af):
